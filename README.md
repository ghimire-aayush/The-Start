# My Data Science and Machine Learning Journey, So far...

## Overview
This repository documents my progress in learning Data Science and Machine Learning during the winter holidays. My primary goal was to build a solid foundation in Python libraries for data analysis, SQL, and basic machine learning concepts. Below, I outline my journey, achievements, and future plans.

---

## Timeline and Progress

### **18.12.24 â€“ Laying Down the Overall Plan**
After finishing my exams for the semester, I set out a structured plan to:
1. Learn Python libraries for data analysis.
2. Revise SQL language and complete a related project.
3. Understand basic machine learning concepts and implement small projects.

---

### **20.12.24 â€“ The More Precise Plan (The Materials)**

To achieve my goals, I used the following resources:
- **Python Data Analysis**: 
  - Book: *[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)* by Jake VanderPlas.
  - Course: *Data Analysis with Python*.
- **SQL Language**: 
  - Book: *Fundamentals of Database Systems* by Elmasri & Navathe (Chapters 6 and 7).
  - Dataset: PostgreSQL's built-in DVD Rental dataset.
- **Machine Learning Concepts**: 
  - Stanfordâ€™s *[CS229 Machine Learning Course](https://cs229.stanford.edu/)*.
  - Practical implementations using Python.

### **28.12.24 â€“ Progress Report I**
- Completed foundational Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- Learned data cleaning, handling missing values, correlation matrices, and time-series analysis.
- SQL revision was quicker than expected; moved to project planning.
- Prepared to dive into scikit-learn and machine learning concepts.

---

### **03.01.25 â€“ Progress Report II**
- Fully completed **Data Analysis with Python** course, including scikit-learn basics.
- Learned ML concepts:
  - Linear & Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Perceptron
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - K-Means Clustering
- Implemented some ML concepts from scratch; others via scikit-learn.

## Projects

### **1. Python Data Exploration (Fossil NOW Dataset)**
This project encompasses:
- Data loading, cleaning, and exploration using Pandas.
- Visualizations (static and geospatial) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- A basic ML model on the dataset.

**Highlights**:
- Explored palaeontology data curated in Helsinki.
- Developed a keen interest in geospatial data analysis.

### **2. SQL Project (DVD Rental Dataset)**
- Practiced SQL queries using PostgreSQL.
- Explored data within the popular DVD Rental dataset.

---

### **3. Neural Network Distinguishing Digits**
- Built a perceptron from scratch to classify handwritten digits (e.g., 5 vs 9).

### **4. KNN from Scratch**
- A small exercise to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm manually.

---

## Reflection

### **Key Takeaways**
1. Solidified understanding of Python libraries for data analysis.
2. Gained confidence in SQL queries and project implementation.
3. Developed foundational knowledge of machine learning concepts.

### **Areas for Improvement**
- Dive deeper into ML concepts and practice implementing models from scratch.
- Explore interactive data visualizations and geospatial analysis.

---

## Future Plans

### **Next Focus Areas**:
1. **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Learn Python libraries for dynamic visualizations.
2. **Geospatial Data Analysis**: Build on my newfound interest in geographical visualizations.
3. **Machine Learning**: Continue exploring advanced algorithms and deep learning concepts.
4. **Deep Learning**: Learning to use PyTorch libary for deep learning, and familiarizing myself with diffent kinds of neural networks

 And Have a project out for each of this to showcase my learning

**Deadline**: End of April 2025.
